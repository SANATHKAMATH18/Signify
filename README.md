# Signify - Speech to ISL

## Overview 
Sign Language is a non-verbal and visual language that is widely used all over the world by the deaf community for communication with others. In India, the Indian Sign Language (ISL) is widely used by the Indian deaf community to communicate with others. However, problems arise when the hearing-impaired persons attempt to communicate with normal people who use spoken language and have no knowledge of Indian Sign Language.So signify was  developed to serve as a complete toolkit for Indian Sign Language by providing different modules to help people work with ISL. The system helps to improve the communication of language-speaking people with deaf people by converting speech and text into animated ISL gestures, and displaying the signs using a 3D avatar. The system also provides facilities for people to learn ISL and to create simple videos using ISL so that the videos can be viewed and understood by the deaf community.
